Basic Computer Organization
- The CPU(stands for Central Processing Unit) (also reffered to as the processor or microprocessor)
- Working memory (usually reffered to as RAM(stands for Random Access Memory))
- Permanent storage (HDD, SSD, USB sticks and etc.)
- Peripherals (everything else)
- System bus (everything that is connected to the CPU conencts through a BUS, or SYSTEM BUS)

The common conceptual parts of a CPU are:
- Registers
- Control unit
- Arithmetic and logic unit
- Memory management unit
- Caches

Registers - tiny blocks of memory inside the processor itself. These are bits of data that the processor can access
directly without waiting. Essentially what happens is that programs load data from memory into the registers, then process
the data in the registers using various instructions, and then write the contents of those registers back out to memory.

The Control Unit - sets the pacing for the chip. It handles the coordination of all the different parts of the chip. It handles
the clock, which doesn't tell time, but is more like a drum beat of a pacemaker - it makes sure that everything operates at the
same speed.

the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) - where proccessing takes place. It does the additions, subtractions, comparisons, etc.
the ALU is normally wired so that basic operations can be done with registers extremly quickly (typically in a single clock cycle).

the Memory Management Unit - in a simple fashion, it manages the way that the processor sees and understands memory addresses.

Caches - A cache is a piece of memory that holds other memory closer to the CPU. For instance, instructions are usually carried
out in the same order that they are stored in memory. Therefore, rather than wait for the control unit to request the next instruction
and then wait for the instruction to arrive from main memory, the CPU can preload a segment of memory that it thinks will be
useful into a cache. That way, when the CPU asks for the next instruction, it doesn’t have to wait on the system bus to deliver
the instruction from memory - it can just read it directly from the cache. CPUs implement all sorts of caches, each of which cache
different things for different reasons, and even have different access speeds.

The Fetch-Execute Cycle - the way that the processor runs programms is through the fetch-execute cycle. The computer operates
by reading your program one instruction at a time. It knows which instruction to read through a special register known as
the Instruction Pointer (or IP), which is also known as the Program Counter (or PC).
The computer essentially runs an endless cycle of the following operations:
- Read the instruction form the memory address specified by the instruction pointer.
- Decode the instruction (i.e., figure out what the instruction means).
- Advance the instruction pointer to the next instruction.
- Perform the operation indicated by the instruction.
Each instruction is extremely limited in its operation. Available instructions do operations like the following:
- Load a value from memory into a register.
- Store a value from a register into memory.
- Do a single arithmetic operation.
- Compare two values.
- Got to a different location in the code (i.e., modify the instruction pointer) based on the result of a 
previous comparison.
