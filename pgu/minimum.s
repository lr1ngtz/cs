# VARIABLES: The registers have the following uses:
#
# %edi - Holds the index of the data item being examined
# %ebx - Smallest data item found
# %eax - Current data item
#
# The following memory locations are used:
#
# data_items - contains the item data. A 5 is used
# to terminate the data
#
 .section .data
data_items: #These are the data items
 .long 3,67,34,262,45,75,54,34,44,33,22,11,5
